          <p>Heykara is a service product that helps users get services like laundry, home cleaning, errands, delivery and meals with ease and at the best quality available. Users can order to get their homes cleaned, fumigated, laundries done, meals prepared and a host of other daily activities. My role here was to work with the team to create a mobile product and a website for users.</p>
          <p style="color: #7D8A80;"><i>A journey to rest and wellness. do more of what you love, while we handle the rest.</i></p>
          <p>I led the design for the product and was tasked with setting product experience.
            We streamlined the onboarding process and built features for its mobile app while directing user research efforts to drive
            demand and customer acquisition.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- The situation on ground Heading -->
        <div class="ourpass-introduction">
          <h1 class="ourpass-introduction-h1">The situation on ground</h1>
          <p>Chores are part of our daily lives, I mean we always have to eat, clean, wash and even run errands. While getting these things
            done are a necessity, there comes a time where they become more of a burden.
            Preparing Meals for example, as far as I know you have to eat, at least on a daily basis. The challenge with this is when you have to
            postpone vital tasks to prepare food thrice in a day or as many times as you eat in a day.
            Hey kara was created to provide a time and cost effective way to get all these done for users while giving them room to focus
            on other more vital activities. However, as with any new business people had reservations and rightly so, for instance, people had
            issues with allowing total strangers into their homes to clean while they weren’t around, or eating food they practically had no idea
            where or how they were prepared. Hence we found it practically difficult to get users onboard and there was a low rate of customer
            adoption.</p>
            
            <p>To solve for these challenges, my goals were simple:</p>
            
            <p><b>• Digitize the ordering process and cut out the need to walk into a business center to get these services, while improving
            public trust in the product.</b><br>
            <b>• Increase customer acquisition by creating designs that paint an understandable picture of the services offered.</b></p>
        </div>
        <!-- Getting Started Heading -->
        <div class="ourpass-introduction">
          <h1 class="ourpass-introduction-h1">Getting Started</h1>
          <p>To improve Hey Kara’s customer acquisition and onboarding metrics, we needed to understand how the current offline model
            of getting these services operated. The goal was to model and perfect this offline experience for the digital space, but without
            its associated flaws. For this, I worked closely with the project manager to organize workshops and hold offline and online
            interview sessions with various potential users.
            We were able to map out the current offline flow and spot pain points that needed improvements, and opportunities to be leveraged.
          </p>
          <img src="./assets/img/page-img/getting-started.png" class="img-responsive margin-top-30" alt="Image">
          <div class="margin-top-20">
            <p>Our research findings helped provide insights that would help us answer these questions</p>

            <p><b>• What already existing offline models do we need to replicate and how do we improve upon them?</b><br>
              <b>• What are the cognitive biases and mental models we will need to consider when designing.</b><br>
              <b>• What factors determine why users would choose to use our product, gaining insight from their offline preferences.</b><br>
              <b>• What are the business constraints</b><br>
              <b>• How do people interact with already existing products.</b></p>
              
            <p>Studying the insights gathered from the workshops helped us identify certain patterns in user behavior.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="margin-top-20">
            <p>We discovered that:</p>

              <p><b>• Users will generally have certain reservations, as with using a new service for the first time, especially with services that 
              tend to get into their personal space.</b><br>
              <b>• Users will like to have some way to keep track of activities going on at their homes, especially when it comes to home
              cleaning and fumigation</b><br>
              <b>• Users will like to have several reservations running simultaneously
              Users will prefer to have multiple payment methods, to facilitate ease in payments.</b><br>
              <b>• As regards payments, users will like to have the option to cancel their subscriptions at any time.
              And lots more…</b></p>
              
              <p>Due to the nature of the project, alongside constant updates and new features, they were arranged with the aid of a prioritization
              matrix and we then set out to solve each of these challenges individually.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <!-- Competitive Analysis Heading -->
        <div class="ourpass-introduction">
          <h1 class="ourpass-introduction-h1">Competitive Analysis</h1>
          <p>
            We later decided to carry out some form of competitive analysis of other products offering similar services in a bid to understandhow they approached similar problems and execute their ideas. To do this, we had to gain first hand experience with some of
            these products to note the things they had done right and connected with our current understanding of why they did certain
            things and how they were done.
            We worked with the agile methodology, building and pushing MVPs incrementally, improving upon each iteration. This allowed us
            work fast test prototypes with users, this helped us put assumptions to test and iterate upon them when necessary, modifying
            the user interface and experience as we gathered insights from usability testing sessions.</p>
